        <p>You already know my name, so here is more about me. I'm majoring in Computer Science currently and previously attended Kingston College.
             I represented Jamaica at Carifta in Triathlon in 2019 and I have many hobbies one being anything technology based. I am interested in web development
            because I believe I can put what I will learn in this course to great use in the future</p>
